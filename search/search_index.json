Grants for domain user Replace domainnamehere\\usernamehere in this script with the correct domain/username and execute it in SQL Server Management Studio to grant the user sufficient permissions. It is good practice to create a dedicated account for SQL monitoring. Grants for SQL User This script uses the default username svc_infrasonar and the password someSuperSecurePasswordHereOfCourse , which you should change before running the script.

The receiving email server is configured to automatically forward all mail sent to the probe address. In our case mailroundtrip@example.org is forwarded to mailroundtrip@mrt.oversig.ht . The mail server mrt.oversig.ht passes the email to the synthetic monitor.

This approach ensures all components such, as DNS, internet connection, email filtering, and email server components involved in receiving and sending email, are part of the measurement. Note Sending an email to all MX records ensures the email fallback scenarios work when you need to rely on them. DNS check The DNS check verifies if an SPF record is configured and valid. SMTP connection We attempt to connect to each mail server found in the DNS MX lookup. Probe configuration The only required configuration property for the SMTP-probe is the mail domain.

Monitoring in this scenario is performed by periodically querying the Windows host using WQL queries. Version 2 of the InfraSonar WMI-probe is released as open source on GitHub and uses the aiowmi library. Prerequisites The WMI-probe requires a service account with domain admin rights or a local administrative to perform the WMI queries. While it is possible to configure a regular user with additional DCOM permissions we feel this provides a false sense of security as the DCOM privileges required are quite broad. Configuration Probe Credentials Credentials for the WMI probe are stored in a credential ini file, see the credentials section in our documentation for detailed information on how to use the credentials file. Monitored asset The WMI-probe requires no configuration on the monitored asset, other then access via the WMI protocol . Firewall requirements Local firewall If the Microsoft Windows local firewall is enabled, you will need to allow \"Windows Management Instrumentation\" traffic. To enable or disable WMI traffic using the firewall UI In the Control Panel, click on Security and then click on Windows Firewall . Click on Change Settings and then click on the Exceptions tab. In the Exceptions window, select the check box for Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to enable WMI traffic through the firewall. To disable WMI traffic, clear the check box. Tip Windows 11 has a special firewall that only allows access from hosts inside the same local subnet. To enable WMI traffic at command prompt using WMI rule group We can easily allow remote WMI using the following set of netsh commands: netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI-In)\" new enable=yes netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"Windows Management Instrumentation (DCOM-In)\" new enable=yes netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"Windows Management Instrumentation (ASync-In)\" new enable=yes Corporate firewall When monitoring hosts which are located behind a firewall, for example hosts in a DMZ, the firewall must be configured to allow WMI. To comply with Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) recommendations, Microsoft has increased the dynamic client port range for outgoing connections in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. The new default start port is 49152, and the new default end port is 65535. This is a change from the configuration of earlier versions of Windows that used a default port range of 1025 through 5000. Windows server below 2008 , access for the RPC Endpoint Mapper (135) as well as WMI (variable port range, by default 1024-5000) should be granted. Windows server 2008 and higher versions . access for the RPC Endpoint Mapper (135) as well as WMI (variable port range, by default 49152-65535) should be granted. You can lookup the dynamic port range actually used by the Windows host using these commands: netsh int ipv4 show dynamicport tcp netsh int ipv4 show dynamicport udp netsh int ipv6 show dynamicport tcp netsh int ipv6 show dynamicport udp Note The range is set separately for each transport (TCP or UDP). The port range is now truly a range that has a starting point and an ending point. Microsoft customers who deploy servers that are running Windows Server 2008 may have problems that affect RPC communication between servers if firewalls are used on the internal network. In these situations, we recommend that you reconfigure the firewalls to allow traffic between servers in the dynamic port range of 49152 through 65535. This range is in addition to well-known ports that are used by services and applications. Or, the port range that is used by the servers can be modified on each server. You adjust this range by using the netsh command, as follows: netsh int set dynamic start= number num= range. This command sets the dynamic port range for TCP. The start port is number, and the total number of ports is range. FAQ How to monitor a Microsoft ISA Server? Monitoring a Microsoft ISA server requires the following rules on the ISA server: Allow traffic from the monitoring appliance to localhost for all protocols. Within this rule, filtering \"Enforce strict RPC compliance\" must be disabled. How to use a local account? None domain members This is only required for hosts that are not a member of your Windows domain or when using a local account is required due to other circumstances. By default only the true local administrator account can be used for remote WMI queries. You can use the following steps to create a local account: Create a local account and ensure the account is member of the group Remote Management Users .

This appliance can be set up manually using this guide or by downloading our ready-to-run OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) here . Initialization Initializing the InfraSonar appliances consists of three steps: Change the default sysadmin password. ( 0versight! ) Configure the network stack. Set the environment variables in the compose file. All these steps can be performed via an SSH shell and a text editor such as Nano . Remote management InfraSonar runs in Docker containers on Linux. Access is possible through the console in your virtualization solution. But a more straightforward approach is to use SSH . SSH access Modern desktop operating systems have the ssh command as part of their terminal. Alternatively, you can download and use PuTTY . SSH access is granted to the sysadmin user, which uses the default password: 0versight! . Nano basics The InfraSonar appliance configuration requires you to edit files using SSH access. The appliance includes the main text editors of vi and nano . Since Nano is easier to use, we outline its essential functions here. In this example, we create a defaultCredentials.ini file for the WMI-probe . See the credentials section for more in-depth information regarding credential files. The easiest way to use Nano, is to open the file you want to edit or create directly using Nano, like this: sudo nano /etc/infrasonar/config/wmiprobe/defaultCredentials.ini Note We assume you are logged on to the appliance using SSH. This command will launch the Nano editor, where you can immediately make changes to the file: Nano screenshot When your edits are done, exit using Ctrl + X . Nano now prompts if you want to Save modified buffers . If you want to save your edits press Y , followed by an Enter to confirm the filename. Press N if you want to discard your edits or Ctrl + C if you want to continue editing. Change password Change the sysadmin password and keep it safe. Login to the appliance using SSH or via virtual machine console and use the passwd command to set the password. $ passwd Changing password for sysadmin. Current password: New password: Retype new password: passwd: password updated successfully Network configuration The InfraSonar appliance ova uses DHCP by default. You can change this to a static IP by editing the file /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml . Note This config file is a YAML file and as such proper indentation is crucial. DHCP configuration Example DHCP configuration (default): /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml network : ethernets : ens160 : dhcp4 : true version : 2 Static IP config Example static IP configuration: /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml network : ethernets : ens160 : addresses : [ 192.168.1.3/24 ] gateway4 : 192.168.1.1 nameservers : addresses : [ 192.168.1.10 , 192.168.1.11 ] version : 2 Apply netplan Apply the netplan configuration using the following command: $ sudo netplan apply Starting InfraSonar For each InfraSonar appliance, OS_CUSTOMER_UUID must be set in the /etc/infrasonar/docker-compose.yml file. The OS_CUSTOMER_UUID can be found by enabling the ID column using the column selector in the InfraSonar environments view . Lookup the correct ID here for the environment you are setting up the appliance for. Warning Starting the Docker environment without setting the correct environment files first can result in abnormal behavior. Verify this step before staring docker-compose. When the environment variables are set, you can start the appliance using the following docker compose command: docker compose -f /etc/infrasonar/docker-compose.yml pull docker compose -f /etc/infrasonar/docker-compose.yml up -d docker-compose.yml details Detailed documentation about the docker-compose.yml file in use by InfraSonar can be found here .

As such, we have two approaches to credential files. Version 1.x and Version 2.x . The table below shows which probes have been ported to the enhanced Version 2.x approach. Probe | credentials path | Version -----------------------------------------------|-----------------0----------------------|------------------------------ Microsoft Azure-probe | /etc/infrasonar/config/azureprobe | 2.x Microsoft SQL-probe | /etc/infrasonar/config/OsMsSqlProbe | 1.x Microsoft WMI-probe | /etc/infrasonar/config/wmiprobe | 2.x NetApp probe | /etc/infrasonar/config/OsNetAppProbe | 2.x Pure storage probe | /etc/infrasonar/config/OsVmwareProbe | 1.x VMware probe | /etc/infrasonar/config/OsVmwareProbe | 1.x Info Please ensure you choose the correct approach for the probe version you are configuring. Credential file The credentials files use the following layout: [credentials] username = <<username used to query the remote host>> password = <<password belonging to the configured username>> When Microsoft Active directory accounts are used the username can be either in domain format domain\\infrasonar_service_account or use the UPN format: infrasonar_service_account@domain.something Version 1.x Default credential file The default credential file is: defaultCredentials.ini Host specific credentials files Specific credentials for a given host can be proved using an <address>.ini file. for example 192.168.99.2.ini Encryption The password is encrypted upon first use by the probe. Reloading The credential files are read every time a check runs. Version 2.x Default credential file The default credential file is: defaultAssetConfig.ini Host specific credentials files Specific credentials for a given host can be proved using an <<probe-address>>.ini file or <<host-uuid>>.ini For example 192.168.99.2.ini or xxxxxxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyyyyyy.ini Using <<host-uuid>>.ini makes it easier to use credentials for hosts using dynamic IP addresses. Encryption The password must be encrypted by an InfraSonar admin using the InfraSonar webinterface. Navigate as an InfraSonar admin to the host where you added the version 2.x probe Click edit host button Select the probe tab Click the link in this section: Passwords in the config files can be encrypted. Use this to encrypt a value. ![credentials_link](../../../../images/credentials_version2_1.png{ width=\"600\" } Enter the password in the value field and press the encrypt button Copy the encrypted password using the copy to clipboard icon Enter the password in the password field of the corresponding credentials .ini file on the appliance. Note The browser does not store either the entered or encyrpted password anywhere, it is just a javascript running in your browser performing the encryption. Reloading Version 2.x probes can be forced to reload the local configuration files by creating an empty file named reload inside the configuration folder. For example: sudo touch /etc/infrasonar/config/micProbe/reload Probe specifics Microsoft Azure probe For the Microsoft Azure probe the credential file looks as such: [credentials] tenantId = `Directory (tenant) ID` clientId = `Application (client) ID` clientSecret = `encrypted client secret` See also the credentials section in the Azure probe documentation .

An example of such a scenario is when a monitored environment will be serviced by another managed services partner. This document outlines our preferred migration approach to ensure uninterrupted monitoring. Migration steps Migrating a monitored environment consists of two steps, which can be performed independently. Monitoring infrastructure transition. Hierarchy transition. However, the actual first step is to contact InfraSonar support to assist with the transition. InfraSonar support ensures a hassle-free transition by aligning all parties involved. Monitoring infrastructure transition This step involves transiting of the InfraSonar implementation inside the monitored environment; in most cases, this is the monitoring appliance . As this appliance is potentially used to provide other services within the monitored environment, we advise starting with setting up a new appliance (with the Agent-core and probes) and transitioning the monitored host to this new Agent-core. This process is similar to decommissioning an Agent-core. We do not recommend a \"rip and replace\" scenario, as this is not beneficial for the monitored environment. If the leaving and receiving parties are discussing terms and conditions, we recommend the following first: Deploy a new Agent-core infrastructure. Perform a hierarchy transition. Move the monitored hosts to the new Agent-core infrastructure. Remove the \"old\" Agent-cores from InfraSonar. Decommission and remove leaving party appliance(s). These steps can be performed without any access to the appliance(s) of the leaving party. Suppose the leaving party demands the appliance to be removed prior to the hierarchy transition. In that case, InfraSonar monitoring will most likely be disturbed when the orphaned hosts are transitioned to the new Agent-core(s). We strongly encourage a gradual and joint approach, as this ensures uninterrupted monitoring services of the monitored environment. Hierarchy transition A hierarchy transition is the move of a monitored environment from a container of the leaving party to a container of the receiving party. This is an administrative action performed inside the InfraSonar cloud platform. This step can only be performed by InfraSonar support and requires written and signed consent by the owner or its representative of the monitored environment. This consent should be sent via email to support@infrasonar.com . InfraSonar support will contact the parties involved to align the timeline for this transition to ensure optimal service for the monitored party. Warning Before a hierarchy transition, the leaving party should verify if the notes section does not contain references that should not be transitioned. During the hierarchy transition , the following irreversible actions will be performed: All custom conditions and labels will be removed, as they are the property of the leaving party. All alarms will be removed, as they might contain the usernames of the leaving party. Historical alerts will be removed, as they contain usernames and references to customizations owned by the leaving party. All Channels configuration will be removed.

Container : Used to organize environments and authorization in those environments. Environment : A business or an IT infrastructure monitored using InfraSonar. Host : A monitored network component in an environment. Breakdown InfraSonar can be broken down in three area's: Monitored infrastructure InfraSonar cloud End-user access In the following sections, we will describe each component with an example implementation to better understand InfraSonar's interwork. Monitored environment A monitored environment commonly refers to a business or an IT infrastructure monitored using InfraSonar. A typical installation consists of a Linux appliance on which all the InfraSonar Agent-cores and probes are installed using Docker . Additional documentation on how to set this up is available here . Probes A probe interfaces with the monitored host or component, which checks and the interval are controlled by the Agent-core. The probe formats the retrieved data in the InfraSonar data format and sends the data via the Agent-core to the InfraSonar cloud platform. Some probes require credentials to access monitored components securely. WMI requires a Windows account to retrieve data from monitored servers remotely. These credentials are encrypted and stored in a configuration file per probe. This way, we ensure credentials are securely stored in the monitored environment. More information on how to configure credentials can be found here . Agent-core The Agent-core controls the check schedular for all probes and ensures that all checks are balanced across the monitored host. The Agent-core is also responsible for communication between the InfraSonar cloud and the monitored infrastructure. The Agent-core sends the collected data from the probes to the InfraSonar cloud and listens to configuration changes performed by InfraSonar admins. InfraSonar cloud The InfraSonar cloud platform is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform . Data from a monitored environment is received and processed in the InfraSonar cloud platform on what we call the Message-hubs. These Message-hubs evaluate the data against configured conditions and store received time series data in SiriDB . Received state data is kept in memory by the Message-hubs. Frontend The InfraSonar user interface is accessible using any modern web browser. User authentication is performed using a personal GitHub account, a personal Microsoft account or a Google account ( this can be a personal or Google workspace account ). Authorization Since InfraSonar is a cloud solution, authorization is an important aspect. Roles The roles that exist in InfraSonar are as follows: Role Description View View only access. Operator View access plus: Assign alerts. Add messages to an alert. Add or remove labels from a host. Admin Operator access plus: Add, edit and remove hosts. Add, edit and remove probes. Manage users on container level. Each role has an additional member property that indicates whether alerts can be assigned to the user. Members are visible in the assignment table. The member property is helpful for organizations where, for example, InfraSonar administrators do not have an operational role or where specific teams are responsible for a customer. Hierarchy Principles A monitored environment is always part of a container . Authorization is inherited to \"lower\" containers. Inheritance can be \"broken\" down the chain. Timezones can be configured per environment. A user with the role admin : Can move a container or environment to another container within that user's authorized scope. Can authorize users on container level.

This document outlines some security considerations to take into account when deploying InfraSonar. Our focus and efforts are aimed at retrieving monitoring data, and sending the collected data securely to the InfraSonar cloud platform for further analysis. Note InfraSonar is not an IT automation tool and cannot make changes to a monitored environment. However, some InfraSonar implementations use the InfraSonar API to integrate with an on-premises automation solution such as Ansible, ensuring a single point of truth for configuration management. Context To properly read this security considerations page, it is essential to keep the following context in mind: InfraSonar monitoring data is collected through: Probes running in a Docker container on the monitoring appliance . Custom collectors are sending data via the InfraSonar API . Collected data is sent to the InfraSonar platform for further analysis and user consumption in the InfraSonar frontend. The platform guide explains this architecture further. InfraSonar design principles Our development team adheres to these principles: Use least privilege accounts to access monitoring data when possible. Use vendor-documented standards such as API or management protocols to query data. When credentials are required, these should be stored encrypted on the monitoring appliance. The customer or managed service provider controls access to InfraSonar data. Avoid third-party libraries when possible. Set up security scanners in our version control system for all projects. Security-related issues take precedence over all other matters. The three states of data InfraSonar processes massive amounts of monitoring data stored for historical analysis, such as trending. We strive to treat all collected data as if it were sensitive data. InfraSonar data can be in one of 3 so-called states. Data at rest Data currently not being accessed, which is stored on a physical or logical medium. InfraSonar stores data in it\u2019s cloud platform on AES256 encrypted disks. The appliance itself has no disk encryption but uses file-based encryption where possible. Data in transit Data that \u201ctravels\u201d between devices. The most straightforward example is emails that are in transit. All data sent between InfraSonar services is SSL encrypted. Data collected by probes is potentially unencrypted, as not all technologies used to collect monitoring data use encryption. SNMP v2c is an example where data is sent without any encryption. Data in use Data actively in use by one or more applications for analysis or for access/consumption by end-users. When data is in use, it needs to be in a readable format; this is especially true for data consumed by end-users. Automated data processing takes place in the datacenters, which have several certifications related to security measurements. These include, but are not limited to: ISO/IEC 27001 ISO/IEC 27017 ISO/IEC 27018 SOC 2 SOC 3 The InfraSonar appliance has no special security measures other than those of the environment in which the appliance is used to protect data. Data classification We use the following data classification for InfraSonar and InfraSonar related data: Restricted Configuration data stored on the monitoring appliance, as this contains (encrypted) credentials. Log data stored on the appliance, as this potentially contains user ids. InfraSonar accounts lists. Sensitive Time series data and performance metrics collected on monitored assets / hosts. State data. InfraSonar platform source code. CRM data. Contracts. Internal InfraSonar back office, such as invoices. InfraSonar support incidents. InfraSonar Slack and email communication. Public InfraSonar open source code: SiriDB - Time series database used in InfraSonar. ThingsDB - NoSQL database used in InfraSonar. InfraSonar probes. InfraSonar documentation. Monitoring appliance The monitoring appliance on which the InfraSonar probes and InfraSonar Agent-core are deployed requires extra attention, as many vendors do not support a 'least privilege' approach to collecting monitoring data. As such, the probes often require the use of highly privileged accounts and sometimes even root or administrator accounts. Our recommendations: Set up SSH Passwordless Authentication. Disable User SSH Passwordless Connection Requests. Disable SSH Root Logins. Use SSH Protocol 2. Set SSH Connection Timeout Idle Value. Limit SSH Access to Certain Users. Configure a Limit for Password Attempts. Update the underlying Linux operating system frequently. Perform a daily pull command for new InfraSonar containers. Use the latest tag for InfraSonar containers unless otherwise specified by InfraSonar support. If your company requires version pinning, please let us know so we can explicitly notify you when we release probe updates. Frequently update the password used by InfraSonar probes. Use disk encryption when possible.","title":"Security"},{"location":"documentation/privacy-security/security_considerations/#security-considerations","text":"InfraSonar is an infrastructure monitoring platform as a service.

InfraSonar conditions are used to evaluate incoming check results. Evaluations take place on the InfraSonar cloud platform. Within InfraSonar, we can identify three methods for data evaluation, which can also be combined, allowing users to build precise and meaningful conditions. Threshold Monitors if a metric is still within the required boundaries. Example: check if the disk space usage is not above 80% State Used to monitor if the desired state is still as it should be. Example: check if a process is still running Comparison Check for differences between the current state and the previous state. Example: check if the list of volumes is not missing items when compared to the previous check result Guidelines Conditions can be assigned to a host via labels. Custom conditions cannot be assigned to pre-defined labels. Combining conditions using and and or or statements is only possible within the boundaries of a check result. Create a condition Custom labels As custom conditions cannot be assigned to pre-defined InfraSonar labels, the first step is to create a custom label or use an already available custom label. Navigate to the conditions page ( ) in the left navigation drawer. Click on the Add condition button. Carefully fill out each of the tabs. General tab InfraSonar add condition general tab Name Enter the name of your condition here. We advise prefixing the condition name with the probe name. Description Enter an optional description. While it's optional, do yourself a favor and describe the condition here. Your future self will thank you. Duration How long should this condition be 'hit' before the condition is raised. Note When the condition: new items , detect missing items or changes is used, the duration must be set to 0 because the new, missing or changed value may be overwritten by a new check result. Severity level InfraSonar uses 8 severity levels derived from the Syslog levels Select the appropriate level for your condition here. level Severity Description 0 Emergency System is unusable. 1 Alert Action must be taken immediately. 2 Critical Critical conditions. 3 Error Error conditions. 4 Warning Warning conditions. 5 Notice Normal but significant conditions. 6 Informational Informational. 7 Debug Messages that contain information normally of use only when debugging. Keep all TODO Auto close When set, the alert is automatically closed if the condition is no longer met. Note Be thoughtful when configuring alerts to auto close. Sometimes you want to know is something happened even though it is ok now. A good example is the \"Reboot detection\", which uses diff uptime as condition trigger. If we would auto close this condition, a reboot alert would only exist for the check interval ~5 minutes. Single alert When a condition is hit by multiple metrics in a check, setting this property ensures only one alert is raised. Note When set, it can be hard to determine the impact as you don't know how many checks are being hit by the condition. Expression tab The first step in the expression tab is to configure the \"path\" to the metrics. This path: InfraSonar add condition expression tab Select a probe . Select a check . Select a type . Select a metric or opt to monitor for item existence . Item existence Is not a metric, but a method that allows you to set a condition on the items returned by the check. Item existence supports the following conditions: Condition Description detect new items Raised when new items are detected compared to the previous check result. detect missing items Raised when items are missing compared to the previous check result. specific items must exist specific items must not exist item in list item not in list metric Depending on the value's data type (string, number or timestamp), a number of operators can be used to set up a condition. A particular operator is the changed operator, which can be used to trigger when the previously measured value deviates from the current measured value. and / or / group Multiple conditions on the same path ( probe/check/type ) can be combined using and & or statements . An optional group function allows for complex expressions. Pro tip Open a host representative for the condition you want to create and click on the download button. This downloads a JSON file containing all data collected for this host and helps you better understand the InfraSonar data format. Also feel free to contact us if you need help. Actions tab In the action tab you can set a custom message. Labels tab In the labels tab you can configure for which labels this condition should be active and or suppressed. Suppressing a global condition The first step is to create a label and prefix it with a \u2260 symbol. InfraSonar create ignore label Duplicate an existing label You can also copy and modify an existing label to suit your needs. Right-click an existing label and choose duplicate. Once you create this label navigate to the condition page. Click on the dropdown icon next to the condition. Select Edit from the menu. Go to the Labels tab . Add the label you want to use for suppressing the condition in the Suppressed for the following label(s) selection. Overwrite a global condition Since you can add multiple conditions to a label, it is possible to overwrite an existing condition with a new one. Create a label or use an existing custom label. We suggest using a regular label type . Navigate to the condition page in the left navigation drawer. Click on the dropdown icon next to the condition you want to overwrite. Select Edit from the menu. Goto the Labels tab . Add the label you want to use in the Suppressed for the following label(s) selection. Save the condition.

Label schedule You can verify the status of scheduled tasks in the ::material-check-circle-outline tasks menu . Deep dive Label classes InfraSonar has five label classes which can be identified by their color. Class Description Base labels in InfraSonar are prefixed with a # sign, followed by a descriptive name. Every host in InfraSonar should be associated with a base label, as these contain the best practices and set the main view for an asset/host. Regular labels are usually used to add extra conditions to a host or for grouping purposes. Ignore labels that are primarily used to suppress a condition are prefixed with a \u2260 sign. Maintenance label suppresses all conditions effectively muting a host. Ansible labels using the InfraSonar API, it is possible to integrate InfraSonar with an automation solutions such as Ansible. InfraSonar uses the & prefix to identify special labels. Custom labels InfraSonar administrators can create custom labels for an environment. InfraSonar add label Navigate to the labels page ( ) in the left navigation drawer. Click the Add label button. Enter a name. Enter an optional description. Click Save . Additional tabs The additional tabs: Hosts , Conditions , Suppressed and Channels show how the label is used. It is not possible to edit the label usage here.

This label is added automatically. CPU 30 min Alert high CPU after 30 minutes. Daily reboot Reports if a Microsoft Windows host is up longer then 24 hours. This label marks a host as daily rebooted, by verifying if the uptime does not exceed 24 hours as this indicates a failed reboot. Reboots are still reported. When a hosts reboots, this will still raise an alert as we can't determine if the reboot was planned. Adding a maintenance routine to your reboot schedule will avoid these alerts.

NetApp dangling snapshots Detects dangling snapshots on NetApp ONTAP systems (7mode and cMode). When the time difference between 2 snapshots is greater than 21 (a.k.a. monthly backup), then an InfraSonar alert is triggered. There is also a label ( dangeling snapshots (vmfs) 7d ) which generates an alert if the snapshot contains the word vmfs and the time difference is greater then 7 days. Possible causes: Manual snapshots that have not been cleaned up. A reconfigured snapmanager. A server that is powered off while the mirror is still running. NetApp SnapMirror lag (>26h) NetApp snap-mirror lag should be less then 26 hours. NetApp SnapMirror lag (>9h) Netapp snap-mirror lag should be less then 9 hours. NetApp snapshots required When applied on a NetApp host every volume is checked whether it has snapshots. NetApp SnapVault lag (>25h) Netapp snap-vault lag should be less then 24 hours.
