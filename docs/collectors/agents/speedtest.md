# :simple-speedtest: Speedtest

## Introduction

The speedtest-agent measures upload and download speeds using Ookla's [speedtest](https://single.speedtest.net/) service.

!!! note "Third party data collection"
    Ookla collects certain data through Speedtest that may be considered personally identifiable, such as your IP address, unique device identifiers or location. Ookla believes it has a legitimate interest to share this data with internet providers, hardware manufacturers and industry regulators to help them understand and create a better and faster internet. For further information including how the data may be shared, where the data may be transferred and Ooklaâ€™s contact details, please see Ookla's [Privacy Policy.](https://single.speedtest.net/about/privacy)

The ping-probe utilizes the [icmp protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)) to monitor the network roundtrip between the monitoring appliance and the monitored host.

## Features

* Monitors upload and download speeds as observed from the agent's perspective

## Deployment

The speedtest agent is easiest deployed as a :material-docker: docker container.

```bash
docker run \
  --name speedtestagent \
  -e TOKEN="<<agent token>>" \
  -e ASSET_ID="<<asset_ID>>" \
  -d \
