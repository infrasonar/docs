# InfraSonar Appliance



## Getting started

InfraSonar probes can easily be deployed and maintained using our easy deployment script





 [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

While it is very possible to deploy InfraSonar on a shared system we advise to use up a dedicated (virtual) Linux :fontawesome-brands-linux: appliance.
We have a ready ro run appliance, which can we found [here]((appliance_installation.md))
