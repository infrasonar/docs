# InfraSonar probes

## Getting started

While it is very possible to deploy InfraSonar on a shared system we advise to use up a dedicated (virtual) Linux :fontawesome-brands-linux: appliance.
We have a ready ro run appliance, which can we found [here](appliance_installation.md)

If you have any docker experience you might want to jump to our [ease deployment script](./deploy_infrasonar.md)
