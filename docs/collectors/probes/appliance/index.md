# InfraSonar probes

InfraSonar probes are deployed and maintained as Docker containers.

While it is very possible to deploy InfraSonar on a shared system we advise to use up a dedicated (virtual) Linux :fontawesome-brands-linux: appliance.

## Ubuntu

Our best supported method of deployment is using a dedicated virtual of physical Ubuntu server installation.

Detailed steps on this installation can be found [here](./ubuntu_installation.md)
