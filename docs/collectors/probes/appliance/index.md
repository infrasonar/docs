# InfraSonar probes

## Getting started

While it is very possible to deploy InfraSonar on a shared system we advise to use up a dedicated (virtual) Linux :fontawesome-brands-linux: appliance.

You can easily [install Ubuntu](./ubuntu_installation.md) yourself or use our [ready to run appliance](./appliance_installation.md).
