# Collectors

InfraSonar collectors collect monitoring data to be parsed by the InfraSonar cloud platform.

Please review our [collector concept documentation](../concept/collectors.md) to gain more insight.

All our general purpose collectors are available as open-source :material-open-source-initiative: on our [GitHub :material-github: page](https://github.com/infrasonar).

Using our extensive libraries we can [easily develop](../support/development.md) additional collectors based upon your needs.
