# Manager Service

The **Manager Service** is a powerful tool designed to enable self-managed monitoring teams.

It provides managers with a quick overview of two key metrics:

- The total number of open alerts and notifications.
- The number of active container members currently monitoring the environment.

The core feature allows you to set a **minimum required number of active monitoring members**. This empowers the team to self-organize their coverage. If the number of active members drops below this threshold, or if alerts remain unassigned for too long, a new alert is automatically sent to the manager, ensuring continuous vigilance and prompting necessary action.
