# Services

A service collector is used to monitor a global service such as, for example, the status of Microsoft 365, AWS health, Google Cloud status, etc.
The collected service status is reported back to all interested containers.

## IPv4 addresses

Our services run in our cloud platform and use the following IPv4 addresses:

- 34.90.55.73
- 34.90.105.247

Ensure assets you want to monitor using a service are allowed to be accessed from these IP addresses.
