> Consolidate and Visualize Your Assets

Views allow you to create comprehensive overviews of multiple assets, grouped by kind and/or label, providing a centralized dashboard for your monitoring data.

## Authorization and Security Considerations

* **Public Links:** While it's possible to generate publicly accessible links for your views, exercise extreme caution. Sharing these links may inadvertently expose sensitive data.
* **Access Control:** Users with container access, even without explicit permissions, can view dashboards. Therefore, carefully consider the information displayed in publicly accessible views.
* **Custom Dashboards:** Leverage views to build customized dashboards tailored to your specific monitoring needs.
