> Consolidate and Visualize Your Assets

Views allow you to create comprehensive overviews of multiple assets, grouped by kind and/or label, providing a centralized dashboard for your monitoring data.

## Sharing views

Views can easily be shared even to users with only access to a container, but without any other permissions.
This is a great feature to create service management dashboards for customers or partners.

A view can be shared using a special link which is shown when clicking the link icon :material-link:, this will provide a URL like this:
```
https://app.infrasonar.com/view/<<some-key>>
```

## User access

Users accessing a shared view IRL can easily mark this view as favorite using the :octicons-star-16: icon in the top right corner.
This allows them to quickly access the view from their home-screen when the logon again.

## Public views

A view can be set to public, allowing access without an InfraSonar account. This feature is useful for sharing the platform's status, such as network uptime or server performance, in a public dashboard. Be aware that sharing this URL grants access to anyone who possesses it.
