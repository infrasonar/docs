# Trash

Asset's are soft-deleted.

When an asset is deleted we remove the collectors from the asset and move the asset to the trash-bin.

## Recovering an asset

When you recover an asset you will need to add the collectors and labels back to this asset.

Kind and description are recovered from the "bin".

When you did not purge the time-series data this will be available again also.
