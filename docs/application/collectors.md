# Collectors

Collectors can be turned of on container level here.

## Propagation

* When turning a collector on or off existing children are not affected.
* Newly created children will inherit the configuration from it's parent.

## Usage

This feature can be used to control which collectors are available on a container.

Disabling unused collectors avoids mistakes and also unclutters the UI.
