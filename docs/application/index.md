# InfraSonar web application

The InfraSonar web application ([https://app.infrasonar.com](https://app.infrasonar.com)) allows users to access the monitoring data and maintain their InfraSonar implementation given their account has sufficient permissions.

The menu on the left reflects the InfraSonar application menu for easy reference.

!!! Tip "The Left hand menu reflects your permissions"
    The left hand menu can vary per user based upon their specific permissions or the containers capacities, billing for example is only visible on those containers were our credit based billing module is applicable.
