# Rules

Rules are a great way to configure notifications for end-users.

## Features

Rules can be setup for a group of conditions and assets and route messages to either DutyCalls or email.

Routing to DutyCalls requires this service to be setup first, see our [DutyCalls documentation](dutycalls.md) for more information.
