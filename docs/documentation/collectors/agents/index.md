# :fontawesome-solid-magnifying-glass: Agents

InfraSonar agents monitor autonomously and send the retrieved monitoring data to the InfraSonar platform using the [InfraSonar API](../../../api/data/insert-data.md)

Agents are a relatively new concept in InfraSonar, as we try to monitor agentless where possible.

## Configuration

An agent requires an InfraSonar API key for authentication and a host [UUID](../../../api/uuid.md) for identification.
