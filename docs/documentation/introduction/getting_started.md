# Getting started with InfraSonar

## Familiarize

We recommend setting up a small-scale testing environment and using this documentation to guide you on your journey to become acquainted with InfraSonar and its terminology.

## Implementation steps

Implementing a basic InfraSonar configuration is easy because InfraSonar can be deployed agent-less and thus leaves no footprint on the monitored infrastructure.

1. **Create an environment**<br>
   The first step is to [create an environment](../web_application/environment.md#setup-a-new-environment) for your assets (hosts).
2. **Deploy the InfraSonar appliance**<br>
   Deploy and setup the [InfraSonar appliance](../collectors/probes/appliance/appliance_deployment.md) in your environment.
3. **Configure probes**<br>
   Setting up (default) [credentials](../collectors/probes/appliance/credentials.md) is the only configuration required in most cases. 
4. **Add hosts**<br>
   [Add hosts](../web_application/assets.md) using the web application.
