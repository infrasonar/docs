# ConnectWise

InfraSonar has a specific API endpoint to integrate with ConnectWise Manage.

This integration allows an InfraSonar environment to be "mapped" to a ConnectWise Manage company, thus allowing the automatic creation of ConnectWise Manage tickets from InfraSonar alerts.

If you want to use this integration, please get in touch with InfraSonar support for assistance.
