# Microsoft SQL server - Determining the Root Cause of Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur in SQL Server when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks on resources. Here are some common approaches to identifying and resolving deadlock issues:

## Review the SQL Server Error Log
* **Check for deadlock messages:** These messages typically include information about the transactions involved, the resources they're contending for, and the deadlock victim.
* **Look for patterns:** If you see recurring deadlocks, it can help pinpoint the root cause.

## Utilize the `sys.dm_exec_requests` Dynamic Management Function (DMF)
* **Monitor active requests:** This DMF provides information about running queries, their blocking status, and the resources they're holding.
* **Identify blocking chains:** Look for circular dependencies where multiple transactions are blocking each other.

## Analyze the `sys.dm_exec_deadlocks` DMF
* **Examine deadlock graphs:** This DMF captures the deadlock graph at the time of the deadlock, showing the transactions involved, the resources they're waiting for, and the locks they're holding.
* **Use tools like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or third-party tools** to visualize the deadlock graph and identify the root cause.

## Enable Deadlock Detection and Tracing
* **Set the `deadlock_trace` option:** This enables SQL Server to capture deadlock information and write it to the error log.
* **Use trace flags:** Trace flags like `3604` can provide additional deadlock information.

## Review Application Code and Query Execution Plans
* **Identify poorly performing queries:** Deadlocks can sometimes be a symptom of inefficient queries that are holding resources for extended periods.
* **Analyze execution plans:** Look for queries that might be blocking other transactions due to excessive locking or resource contention.

## Consider Index Optimization
* **Ensure appropriate indexing:** Well-designed indexes can help reduce blocking by minimizing the time transactions hold locks on data pages.
* **Avoid index fragmentation:** Regularly rebuild or reorganize indexes to improve query performance and reduce blocking.

## Adjust Transaction Isolation Levels
* **Use a lower isolation level:** If appropriate, consider using a lower isolation level (e.g., `READ UNCOMMITTED`) to reduce blocking, but be aware of the potential for dirty reads.
* **Balance isolation and concurrency:** Choose an isolation level that strikes the right balance between data integrity and concurrency.

## Monitor and Tune Application Behavior
* **Identify hotspots:** Look for areas of your application that frequently experience deadlocks.
* **Optimize application logic:** Modify application code to avoid patterns that can lead to deadlocks, such as long-running transactions or excessive locking.

By following these steps and carefully analyzing the information provided by SQL Server, you can effectively identify and address the root causes of deadlocks in your database.
