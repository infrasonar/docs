## Our Journey: From Oversight to InfraSonar

InfraSonar's story began in 2013 as "Oversight," the vision of a senior software developer (Jeroen) and an IT architect (Rik), driven by a shared passion for high-quality software solutions.

In April 2023, we launched a completely redesigned platform, InfraSonar, building upon the lessons learned from our earlier iteration. This evolution resulted in a more versatile and resilient platform, capable of monitoring not only traditional IT environments but also any system requiring detailed state and performance insights.
