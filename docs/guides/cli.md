# command line interface

The InfraSonar client is a command-line application which can be used to manage [assets](../concept/assets.md) for a [container](../concept/containers.md). 

The tool has two main features. One is to read all assets from a container to YAML or JSON output. Zones, labels and collectors are included. The other feature of this tool is to apply a YAML or JSON file to InfraSonar. These two features combined allow you to easily add new assets as well as managing existing assets for a container.
