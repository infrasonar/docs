## Your collector needs covered by us

We understand that every environment is unique, and sometimes, standard monitoring tools just don't cut it. That's where we come in. We offer a specialized service to help you develop custom data collectors, allowing you to monitor the specific metrics that matter most to your business.

Imagine being able to track the performance of that custom application you built, or get detailed insights from a specialized piece of hardware. With our team's expertise, we can turn those monitoring needs into reality. We'll work closely with you to understand your requirements, and provided we have the necessary information, we aim to deliver an initial, functional version of your custom data collector within just two weeks.

If your custom collector addresses a need shared by a wider audience, we'll integrate it into our core product at no extra cost. This means you not only get the precise monitoring you need, but you also contribute to a more comprehensive solution for everyone.
