We provide extensive remote support specifically tailored to your infrastructure monitoring needs.

Our team is dedicated to helping you get the most out of InfraSonar. 

We begin by expertly guiding you through the initial setup process, ensuring a smooth and efficient start. 

Following setup, we provide comprehensive assistance in configuring InfraSonar to precisely align with your unique environment and monitoring requirements. 

Understanding alerts and notifications is crucial, and we're here to help you make sense of them, enabling you to proactively address potential issues. 

Furthermore, we empower you to extend your monitoring capabilities by providing support in developing custom collectors, allowing InfraSonar to monitor even the most specialized aspects of your infrastructure. 

As a standard part of our service, you can rely on our responsive email support for any questions or assistance you may need. 

For more direct support, we offer optional paid services, including remote sessions where our experts can connect directly to your system to provide hands-on guidance and accelerate issue resolution. In specific, critical situations where remote support may not be sufficient, we also offer on-site visits to provide direct, in-person expertise, subject to availability and additional terms.
