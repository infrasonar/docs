# InfraSonar Expression language

In InfraSonar, most conditions leverage a powerful, custom expression language to test your data. We specifically designed this language for its flexibility.

A key advantage over a purely graphical interface is the ability to embed comments directly within your expressions. This means you can thoroughly explain the rationale behind specific tests, significantly improving readability and maintainability for your team.

Despite its power, we've kept the language simple and robust, ensuring a gentle learning curve. Its built-in data type checking actively helps prevent common mistakes, making your expressions more reliable.
