## See your infrastructure clearly, all in one place

Imagine having a single pane of glass where you can see the most important information about your infrastructure, no matter where it comes from. That's the power of Views. They allow you to bring together data from different assets and collectors into a unified and understandable format.

Here's how Views can help you:

- **Tailored Team Dashboards**: Equip specialized teams with custom dashboards relevant to their specific needs.
- **Enhanced Customer Communication**: Provide customers with controlled access to key asset data, like SLA performance, fostering transparency.
- **Streamlined Troubleshooting**: By combining diverse detailed sources into a consistent view, engineers can effortlessly spot connections and underlying causes.
- **Simplified Resource Management**: Get a comprehensive overview of resources, for instance, easily identifying all active Windows service accounts.

Views transform the vast amount of detailed monitoring data collected by InfraSonar into focused, actionable insights.

## Secure Access

Control access precisely by setting up view-only permissions, ensuring accounts used for dashboards are restricted to the data displayed within the view.
